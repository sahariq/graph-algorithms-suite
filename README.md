# Graph Algorithms Implementation

This project implements various graph algorithms including:
- Single Source Shortest Path (Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford)
- Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's and Kruskal's)
- Graph Traversal (BFS and DFS)
- Graph Diameter
- Cycle Detection

## Setup
1. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Download a graph dataset from http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html
   - Save it as 'sample_graph.txt' in the project directory
   - The file should be in edge list format

3. Run the program:
```bash
python graph_algorithms.py
```

Results will be saved in 'results.json'
